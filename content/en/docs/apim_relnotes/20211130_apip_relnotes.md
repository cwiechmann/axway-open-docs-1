## Known issues

The following are known issues for this update.

### Elasticsearch datastore is not updated immediately after approving applications in API Portal

For API Portals connected to an Elasticsearch server, the Elastic index is not automatically updated after an application is approved. As a result, the application is listed in *Pending* state in the applications catalog until the next execution of scheduled indexation cron job.

You can perform the following steps to manually trigger the indexation of the applications:

1. In JAI, click **Components > API Portal > Elasticsearch Settings**.
2. Click **Index Applications now**.

For more information, see [Configure Elasticsearch in API Portal](/docs/apim_installation/apiportal_install/install_software_elastic).

Related issue: IAP-4638

### Application is not immediately visible in the applications catalog when it is created and it is in pending state

For API Portals connected to an Elasticsearch server, the Elastic index is not automatically updated after an application is created in *Pending* state. As a result, the application is not listed in the applications catalog until the next execution of scheduled indexation cron job.

You can perform the following steps to manually trigger the indexation of the applications:

1. In JAI, click **Components > API Portal > Elasticsearch Settings**.
2. Click **Index Applications now**.

For more information, see [Configure Elasticsearch in API Portal](/docs/apim_installation/apiportal_install/install_software_elastic).

Related issue: IAP-4639

### Sorting the Applications catalog works only on the current page

API Portals connected to an Elasticsearch server have pagination enabled in the Applications catalog. Sorting the list of applications works only on the current page. If you go to the next or previous page, the sorting is lost and you have to apply it again every time you navigate to another page.

Related Issue: IAP-4289

### When Multi Manager feature is configured, API Portal users are no longer able to login

After a recent bug fix in API Manager (RDAPI-20021), the `Authenticate to Master` policy is no longer working after upgrading from releases earlier than [API Portal July 2020](/docs/apim_relnotes/20200730_apip_relnotes/). To fix this, perform the following steps:

1. Open all slave managers configurations in Policy Studio, and click to **Edit** the `AuthenticateToMaster` policy.
2. Click the **Login to Master** (Connect to URL) filter, and enter `Accept: */*` for the **Request Protocol Header**.
3. Click the **Enter** key twice to create two blank lines after `Accept: */*`.

Alternatively you can take the updated `AuthenticateToMaster` policy and apply again your configurations.

### Page layout and alignment for Arabic language

Changing the API Portal language to Arabic (or any other right to left language) results in issues with page layout and alignment on the API Portal Home and Pricing pages, and some buttons are not visible. As a workaround, you can turn on the development mode in JAI. Follow these steps:

1. Log in to Joomla! Admin Interface (JAI).
2. In the JAI top navigation bar, click **Extensions > Templates**.
3. Click your template style (for example, `purity_III * Default`) to open it.
4. Click the **General** tab.
5. Change **Development Mode** to `ON`.
6. Click **Save** and click **Close** to close the template style.
